Using external JavaScript files refers to the practice of storing JavaScript code in separate files with a .js extension and
then including these files in HTML documents. This approach helps keep web development projects organized, promotes code reusability, and separates the structure (HTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) of a web page.
