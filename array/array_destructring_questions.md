1. Basic Destructuring
Question: Given an array arr = ["Hello", "World"], use array destructuring to assign the first value to a variable named greeting and the second value to a variable named place.

2. Swap Variables
Question: Swap the values of two variables a and b using array destructuring. Initially, a = 10 and b = 20.

3. Default Values
Question: Given an array arr = [10], use array destructuring to assign the first value to a variable num1 and the second value to a variable num2 with a default value of 5.

4. Nested Destructuring
Question: Given an array arr = [1, [2, 3], 4], use nested array destructuring to assign the second element of the nested array to a variable named innerValue.

5. Rest Operator
Question: Given an array arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], use array destructuring and the rest operator to assign the first two elements to variables and the rest of the elements to an array named others.

6. Skipping Elements
Question: Given an array arr = ["a", "b", "c", "d"], use array destructuring to assign the third element to a variable named third and skip the rest.

7. Destructuring Assignment in Functions
Question: Write a function that takes an array as an argument and uses destructuring to return the first and last elements as an object with properties first and last.

8. Using Destructuring in Function Parameters
Question: Write a function that takes an array as a parameter and uses array destructuring directly in the parameter list to extract and return the first element.

9. Mixed Destructuring
Question: Given an array arr = [{ key: 'value' }, [10, 20, 30]], use a combination of object and array destructuring to assign the string 'value' to a variable named str and the number 30 to a variable named num.
