# Reference vs Address

## Reference (English)
A reference in programming points to an object or value, letting you work with it without knowing its memory location. It simplifies managing objects.

## Reference (Hinglish)
Programming mein, reference ek object ya value ko point karta hai, bina uski memory location jaane aap uske saath kaam kar sakte hain. Ye objects manage karne ko asaan banata hai.

## Address (English)
An address is a specific location in memory where data is stored. It's like a house's address but for data.

## Address (Hinglish)
Address memory mein data ke store hone ki specific location hoti hai. Ye data ke liye ek ghar ke address ki tarah hota hai.
