Static pages
Static web pages are fixed content web pages that are served to the user exactly as they are stored. Each page is a separate HTML file on the server, and when a user requests a page, the server sends the HTML file directly to the user's browser.

Personal blogs
Company landing pages
Portfolio websites
Brochure sites

frontend 
The frontend is the part of a website or app that you see and interact with. It's everything that shows up on your screen and responds to your actions.

ex
When you visit a website and see a beautiful homepage with pictures and text, that's the frontend.
When you fill out a form to sign up for a newsletter, the form you see and type into is part of the frontend.

backend 
The backend is the part of a website or app that you don't see. It's like the behind-the-scenes engine that makes everything work.

Ex
When you log into a website, the backend checks if your username and password are correct.
When you post a picture on social media, the backend saves it and makes sure your friends can see it.

A server is a powerful computer or program that provides services or information to clients. It processes requests from clients and sends back the needed data.

Simple Example:

Client: Your phone or computer when you use it to browse the internet.
