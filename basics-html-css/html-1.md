Sure! Hereâ€™s a simple definition of HTML:

### HTML

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It's the basic building block for creating web pages. Think of it as the skeleton of a website that tells your browser how to display text, images, and other content.

### Simple Analogy

HTML is like the framework of a house. Just as a house has walls, doors, and windows, a webpage has headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML is what you use to put those elements in place.
