# Understanding `setTimeout` and `setInterval` in JavaScript

JavaScript provides two main functions for timing-related tasks: `setTimeout` and `setInterval`. These functions allow you to execute code at specific time intervals.

## `setTimeout`

### What is `setTimeout`?

`setTimeout` is a function that is used to execute a piece of code after a specified delay. The delay is measured in milliseconds.

### How does it work?

When you use `setTimeout`, you are telling the JavaScript engine to wait a certain amount of time and then execute the code inside the `setTimeout` function.

### Example

```javascript
console.log("Hello");
setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("Goodbye");
}, 2000);
```

In this example, "Hello" is printed immediately to the console, and after 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds), "Goodbye" is printed.

## `setInterval`

### What is `setInterval`?

`setInterval` is similar to `setTimeout`, but instead of executing the code once after a delay, it executes the code repeatedly at regular intervals.

### How does it work?

With `setInterval`, the JavaScript engine runs the code inside the `setInterval` function repeatedly every X milliseconds, where X is the interval you specify.

### Example

```javascript
setInterval(function() {
    console.log("Repeating message");
}, 1000);
```

In this example, "Repeating message" is printed to the console every 1 second (1000 milliseconds).

## Conclusion

Both `setTimeout` and `setInterval` are essential for controlling the timing of your code execution in JavaScript. They are especially useful in scenarios like delaying an action, creating animations, or updating the UI at regular intervals.
