Certainly, here's a list of 10 beginner-friendly loop questions in a simple format:

1. **Basic `for` Loop**: Write a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
2. **`for` Loop with Step**: Use a `for` loop to print even numbers between 2 and 10.
3. **Reverse `for` Loop**: Create a `for` loop that counts down from 5 to 1.
4. **Summing Numbers with `for`**: Write a `for` loop that sums up the numbers from 1 to 5, then print the sum.
5. **`for` Loop over Characters**: Use a `for` loop to print each character in the string "Hello".
6. **Basic `while` Loop**: Write a `while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
7. **`while` Loop with Condition**: Create a `while` loop that starts with a variable at 10 and prints numbers until it reaches 0.
8. **`do...while` Loop Basics**: Write a `do...while` loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
9. **`do...while` Loop with Control Variable**: Use a `do...while` loop where the loop stops when a control variable named `stop` becomes true.
10. **Nested Loops**: Write a `for` loop inside another `for` loop to print a 3x3 grid of asterisks (*).

These questions cover a range of basic uses for loops in JavaScript and will help beginners get comfortable with writing and understanding loop structures.
